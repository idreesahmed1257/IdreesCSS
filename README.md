# Idrees.css

## Note:-
I am actively adding new classes and updates to Idrees.css. Therefore, if you are using an older version of Idrees.css, please make sure to synchronize it with the latest version to access the latest classes and improvements. 

Idrees.css is a lightweight CSS framework that provides a viable alternative to Bootstrap when you only need a specific set of classes without the need for the entire Bootstrap library. It offers a convenient way to access commonly used classes such as "mx-2", "mt-5", "d-flex", "text-bold," and column grid layouts, allowing you to quickly style your web pages without the overhead of a larger framework.

## Purpose

The purpose of Idrees.css is to provide developers with a minimalistic CSS solution that focuses on the most frequently used classes found in frameworks like Bootstrap. Instead of including the entire Bootstrap library, which can be heavy and overwhelming, you can simply download Idrees.css and leverage its built-in classes for effortless styling.

By using Idrees.css, you can enjoy the benefits of a lightweight framework while still utilizing the convenience and power of pre-defined classes. This allows for faster loading times, reduced file size, and improved performance compared to using larger frameworks when you only need specific styling capabilities.
